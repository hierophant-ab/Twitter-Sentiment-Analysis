# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
A machine learning project that classifies tweets into sentiment categories (positive, negative, neutral). This repository covers the complete pipeline â€” from raw tweet preprocessing (removing URLs, mentions, hashtags, and handling emojis) to feature extraction (TF-IDF/Word2Vec) and model building (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Neural Networks).

**Key Features:
**</br></br>
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handle noise in tweets (hashtags, mentions, links, emojis).</br>
Feature Engineering: Text vectorization using Bag-of-Words, TF-IDF, and Word Embeddings.</br>
Modeling: Implements baseline ML classifiers and advanced models for comparison.</br>
Evaluation: Performance measured with accuracy, F1-score, ROC-AUC.</br>
Visualization: Distribution of sentiments and word clouds for insights.</br></br>

**Goal**: To explore natural language processing (NLP) techniques and build a robust sentiment classification system for social media data.
